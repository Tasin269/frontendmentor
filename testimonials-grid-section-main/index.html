          I received a job offer mid- course, and the subjects I learned were
          current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
          got every penny's worth.

          I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been
          looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
          amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
          found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
          weeks was the best- and most grueling -time of my life. Since
          completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as
          a Software Engineer at a VR startup.

          work as a mobile engineer for a big company. This was one of the best

          Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
          Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was
          easy.

        <h2 class="review-two">
          The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find
          really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be
          able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior
          developer. The standard is above the rest. You will let the personal
          attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing
          people.

        <h2 class="review-two">
          Before joining the bootcamp. Ive never written a lines 0 code. needed
          s some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming
          step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs
          who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire
          curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I
          never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in
          particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in
          a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred
          to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
          certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after
          receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!
